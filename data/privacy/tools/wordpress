### Wordpress Privacy Tools

For any website a good first start in privacy policy would be to create a privacy policy webpage. 
Wordpress provides an option to assign your webpage as the main privacy policy information page, the place to provide information and get visitors consent for your business privacy policy.
Actually the option is just a shortcut to a page, but it's a nice small reminder to take care of your visitors privacy.
