### GDPR (EN)

2018 05 25 - General data protection regulation (AVG) applicable (EU) instead of. the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp). For everyone, except for Justice and police, collecting and processing personal data (privacy data) has been in force since the 25th of May 2018.

### Main points

- Transparency: Clearly inform about how the personal data is collected, processed and transferred.

- Accountability: Companies have a documentation obligation, a duty of proof and the responsibility to reduce privacy risks with regard to personal data.

- Consumer rights

    The right to view, correct or delete your own data.
    The right to request personal data in an accessible file format (eg Excel) and transfer it to other companies.
    The right to be forgotten: companies must delete personal data if the person requests it. This must be done immediately and at the latest within one month. Note: this also applies to data that has since been shared with third parties.

- Reporting obligation for data leaks: Companies are obliged to report a data leak within 72 hours, unless it can be demonstrated that the leak is not a hazard for the persons on whom the data have been collected.

- Privacy by design and privacy by default: In the case of privacy by design, technical and organizational information is carefully processed with personal data when developing new products or services. Privacy by default means that measures are taken to collect only the necessary data by default for the purpose for which you collect them.

### Personal data

##### What does the AVG understand by special personal data?
Personal data that are very sensitive by nature, including genetic data and biometric data if they can be traced back to a person.

### Commitment

As of 25 May, organizations under the AVG are obliged to perform a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) if processing may involve a high risk for the rights and freedoms of those involved.

### Foundations

The AVG has 6 principles for the processing of personal data:

- Permission from the person concerned.
- Data processing is necessary for
  - the execution of an agreement.
  - compliance with a legal obligation.
  - to protect the vital interests.
  - the fulfillment of a task of general interest or exercise of public authority.
  - the representation of legitimate interests.

Personal data can not be processed without the above-mentioned principles.
